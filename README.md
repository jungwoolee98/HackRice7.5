# HackRice7.5

Everybody knows the page Rice Students Ubering Together.

We decided to automate this process using SlackBot.

Basically, before when people wanted to find other people to uber together with to the airport, they would have to go to a spreadsheet, search for the airport, search for a time, and see if there were slots available.

But now, with our SlackBot, the whole process is automated.

All you need to do is join our Slace Workspace, and you can use commands for our bot -- Starter Bot. 

Now you can just tell Starter Bot a command and it will automatically put you into a private channel with other people that are going to the same airport on the same date and time!
